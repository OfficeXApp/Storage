# Developer To Do

## Overview

- [ðŸ”µ] Clear download / Pause download

## UX Confusion Fixes

- [ ] Setup hoverable thumbnail previews for videos
- [ ] Thumbnails for files/images/video + driveui tile mode

- [ ] Users expect autocopy to clipboard when generating magic links

- [ ] It appears that ancestor breadcrumbs are exposing private ancestor folders
- [ ] After agree to join group or individual, its showing 404 not found
- [ ] Fix the create org modals that close too early

## Polish Checklist

- [ ] Clear optimistic cache when 401 unauthorized
- [ ] Fix all the places where .replace() doesnt use proper regex match all

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out a unified tag framework --> `{nickname}:{id}@`
- [ ] Implement permissions on frontend (redux, reuseable ui pickers, crud)
- [ ] Support multi offline organizations
- [ ] Investigate & consolidate auth cookies
- [ ] Investigate & consolidate all indexdb databases

## Nice Updates after Prod

- [ ] Ability to offline create disks, folders, etc (when offline create disk, its missing root folder & trash folder)
- [ ] Add bulk delete & single file page move/copy/delete
- [ ] Api key tab, change edit to manage and put inside edit & revoke. the current place where revoke it, change to "Login As"

## Backlog

- [ ] Add onEnter to submit forms
- [ ] User initiated superswap_userid as a form of account "recovery" when they've lost/compromised their seed phrase. This should be added as a permission with grantee being a user/group etc.
- [ ] Pretty short links `drive.officex.app/r/uuid-redirects-to-long-form`

## Done

- [x] Make sure switch users will persist who the current user is, so that upon browser restart its seamless to get user back in
- [x] Setup multi-organizations
- [x] Setup default profile per organization, UX sugar (can just be most recent)
- [x] Setup API keys for organization <> profile with /organization/whoami
- [x] Factory deploy drive, connect to frontend
- [x] Contacts UI pages
- [x] Regenerate REST API docs & types with new routes, `/organization/whoami`, `/organization/superswap_user`, `/organization/redeem`
- [x] Ensure that offline cached requests work across multiple orgs & profiles
- [x] Consider how to build local read replicas of known state (authorized sub-state), in an offline manner --> solution is to use client generated uuid and build state representation in local indexdb ourselves
- [x] Hook up redux-offline with a long term ui state storage, maybe an indexdb local read replica or redux-cache when offline? its okay to call backend every page load, but when offline need to get the data from somewhere. maybe we get rid of explicit persist cache on disks-et-al and only cache offline. when no internet we query direct from localstorage? thus redux offline only handles mutations (create, update, delete) while queries (get, list) are handled by custom logic searching indexdb. --> seems more sensible to seperate out logic for mutations vs queries
- [x] Contacts crud routes (with redux-offline)
- [x] fix add webhooks component
- [x] Polish all tables to match groups behavior (got rid of OPEN button and clicking name goes into tab directly no untab, clicking rest of row tabs/untabs without navigating to it)
- [x] Fix uploading to indexdb which saves raw chunks but doesnt save into dexie files hashtable (we might want to undo our indexdb.adapter which replced uploadid with fileid, possibly incorrect)
- [x] Fix upload process with inherent folder direvtory preservation (uploading folder should preserve directory)
- [x] Create a unified provider for handling uploads to different end destinations
- [x] Cleanup/refactor directory reducers & optimistic middleware to handle the diverse file uploading
- [x] Fix the lack of duplicate handling for files & folders
- [x] Implement actual file uploading & panel showing progress (from DriveUI too!)
- [x] Add FilePage UI
- [x] Implement magic link directory permission
- [x] Invite contact with redeem feature
- [x] Share folder & guests can upload properly
- [x] Implement password directory permission
- [x] Invite system with smooth onboarding & sharing (1-2 days)
- [x] Implement magic link groups
- [x] Patch free cloud filesharing to have the presigned s3 url in the share link via btoa encoding
- [x] Edit file/folder name
- [x] Deploy to staging, might need to refactor auth to use query string since ICP boundary nodes are being weird about CORS authorization headers even though postman works
- [x] Proper optimistic rendering for everything
- [x] Implement "Default Disk" and hide disks
- [x] Fix optimistic vs actual load positioning (order of rows may change and result in jarring experience)
- [x] Trash bin functionality
- [x] Delete file folder / Restore trash / Delete forever
- [x] Add directory syncing indicator for when loading files/folders from cloud
- [x] Update list directory call with a permissioned full path checker (for driveui breadcrumbs)
- [x] Refactor drive ui back button to actually check parent folder to navigate grandfather
- [x] Reduce amount of initial REST calls, just contacts, groups & disks needed (we already cache the permission checks)
- [x] Cache the breadcrumbs directory navigation
- [x] Back button on /drive for when new user arrives
- [x] Blitzkreig the rest of the crud routes?
- [x] Blitzkreig the rest of the crud UI?
- [x] Fix frontend optimistic bug where old contact still exists after superswap user redeemed
- [x] Add 404 Pages
- [x] Shared with me results with breadcrumbs
- [x] Multi-Select Files/Folders
- [x] Move/Copy Files/Folders
- [x] In organization settings, for current user, ability to change the api key
- [x] In settings page, a special modal for generating an auth signature (for developer convinence such as when they want a temp auth token or call the `/api-keys/create` endpoint)
- [x] Refactor settings page, including redeem gas gift card
- [x] Search results page
- [x] Audit & Fix all loading states & caches. Add subtle loading indicators across UI pages
- [x] Default offline contacts / api keys
- [x] When adding a new org, dont just refresh page, go to /drive just in case
- [x] Fix bugs when removing an org or profile, proper redirects, etc
- [x] Magic login link with redeem placeholders (both for contacts themselves, and via group invite, also FactorySpawnOrgResponseData). replace password login scheme string, with a btoa password (before: "DriveID_abc123:password123@https://endpoint.com", after: RHJpdmVJRF9...dC5jb20) url safe ?password=btoa
- [x] Cache bug where switching from owner to anon account, the anon seems to copy cache of admin... investigate
- [x] Switching orgs doesnt immediately load resources despite listening for it in useEffect App.tsx. check cache issues
- [x] Smart smooth sidemenu nav opens closes based on which page
- [x] Implement /drive with disk_default_action to determine if we show Trash, Shared, Regular Directory
- [x] Implement recents tab with its own dexie table of recent files/folders opened, update driveui & filepage to append recents
- [x] Investigate why uploading large files doesnt work (2GB+) --> onvisibilitychange was force stopping uploads on tab unfocus
- [x] Fix upload progress bar bug where uploading large files to canister/storj/s3 will succeed but appear blue progress bar stuck and incorrect summary
- [x] Show warning message on file page if file status was not completed uploading
- [x] Fix the dangerous duplicate downloading on FilePage (2GB file gets downloaded 4x right away)
- [x] Delete files will delete from storj/s3/canister
- [x] Add a loading state indicator to the unauthorized page as sometimes it just takes time to load
- [x] Not obvious how to add permissions to directory (hidden behind advanced, maybe we should make everything public by default?) --> resolved by making advanced table visible and add button blue primary
- [x] Make it easier to share public links --> resolved by making public the default selection when creating a new directory permission
- [x] If a disk root is unauthorized to view, perhaps we can auto-redirect to "shared with me" to avoid user confusion --> resolved by making "Shared with Me" button primary blue
- [x] Its not obvious when a file is public via parents, it will say private but then still be public if ancestor folder is public. but no ui warning users
- [x] Website turned blank when remove public permission
- [x] Upload file will default upload to offline browser cache and appear error, confusing users. lets just navigate to /drive instead
- [x] Can't easily see userID on mobile
- [x] Searchbar in driveui
- [x] Its confusing when contacts dont have access to disks, we should by default give the "All Contacts" group read access to the disk root folder --> resolved by making "Shared with Me" button blue primary. users would get annoyed if their entire disk was public/semi-public by default as they would assume a blacklist paradigm instead of whitelist
- [x] Show error message for strangers when they go to anywhere/drive that they dont have access (right now it appears that they can use it)
- [x] Accept group invite/contact should inherit the name, instead of "unnamed contact"
- [x] Playing large video files appear to be broken due to needing to download entire file upfront. Refactor video player to use streaming player instead of native html video tag. We dont need to make any changes to backend file storage. --> changed from native html to a dedicated videojs library for streaming
